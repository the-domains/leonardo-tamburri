"I want to feed meaning until it is full."

I am currently the Art Director and Creative Manager of the G Adventures' Brand Department, leading a team of talented creative professionals.

I joined the very small in-house marketing department back in 2006 as a freelance designer focussed on helping out with the company's brochure production. Having joined the company at a critical time in its existence, I made the most of the opportunity and helped transform the way a great travel company handles its creative work. I gained a wealth of experience when I helped to build the creative team of three into an in-house agency of 24\.

Colleagues know me as a high-energy creative marketer who juggles multiple projects with ease. Fuelled by caffeine and good beats, I love to work with motivated creatives with a passion for solving visual problems and never tire of conjuring up new and better ideas to tell stories and keep audiences hanging of my every pixel, word, bezier curve and photograph.
